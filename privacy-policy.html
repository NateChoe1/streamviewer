<h1>The official streamviewer TOS and privacy policy</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>Many sites separate their TOS and privacy policy into two separate documents
that you have to slog through individually. I don't like that, so I've combined
them both into a single web page.</p>

<h2>Begin TOS and privacy policy</h2>

<h2>Part 1: Definitions</h2>

<p>Most legal documents start with a series of definitions, so I guess I'll do
that too.</p>

<p>In this document, "I", "we", and "me" refers to Nate Choe, the webmaster of
https://natechoe.dev as of the year 2024, and the original creator of the
streamviewer tool.</p>

<p>"You" and "the user" refers to you, a person who authorizes their Google
account to the streamviewer program.</p>

<p>"This service", "the service", "this program", "the program", and similar
derivations refer to the streamviewer program.</p>

<p>"Google" refers to Google LLC.</p>

<p>"Youtube" refers to the video and livestreaming service created by Google.</p>

<p>"Cloudflare" refers to Cloudflare Inc. and their many products, including
Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages.</p>

<h2>Part 2: The TOS and privacy policy</h2>

<p>This page is hosted with Cloudflare pages, and the backend is hosted with
Cloudflare workers. Cloudflare may collect certain information about your
browser, including your IP address, user agent, and other browser metadata. I am
not liable for the data that Cloudflare collects. Cloudflare's privacy policy
can be viewed at <a
href=https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/>https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/</a>.</p>

<p>Youtube wants me to add a link to their terms of service, so here it is: <a
href=https://www.youtube.com/t/terms>https://www.youtube.com/t/terms</a></p>

<p>This service utilizes the Youtube APIs, which are subject to Google's privacy
policy, located at <a
href=https://www.google.com/policies/privacy>https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Youtube and Google hire thousands of the smartest
engineers on the planet, it's not possible, or at least very difficult, to write
a program to view a Youtube live chat without logging in to a Google account.
When you log in to a Google account, Google generates an "oauth2 token", which
programs can use to access certain Google services. For some reason, you need an
oauth2 token to get a stream chat ID. This requires you to log in to the
streamviewer service. The oauth2 token never leaves your computer, and is never
stored on your computer.</p>

<p>This also means that I can't revoke the oauth2 token that was generated,
since I never get it in the first place. This is a problem, as Youtube requires
that I provide a way to revoke oauth2 tokens. Oauth2 tokens can be revoked
through the Google security settings page at <a
href=https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions>https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a>.
This is the official way to revoke tokens, because I literally cannot do
anything on my end.</p>

<p>You can contact the developer at <a
href=mailto:nate@natechoe.dev>nate@natechoe.dev</a>.</p>

<p>You are allowed to exploit/hack/break streamviewer, under the conditions that
you don't collect any user data, that you don't cause unnecessary damage beyond
proving that streamviewer is exploitable, and that you responsibly disclose any
vulnerabilities you find to <a
href=mailto:nate@natechoe.dev>nate@natechoe.dev</a>.</p>

<h2>End TOS and privacy policy</h2>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>It's probably pretty obvious by now, but I'm not a lawyer. Just don't break
the law while using this software and you're probably fine.</p>
